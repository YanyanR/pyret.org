@section{Disclaimer}

Pyret is still early in its life of releases.  We will make
backwards-incompatible changes (while keeping old versions of the language
available) in order to keep improving quickly.  We'll announce potentially
breaking changes both on our main list and on
@link["https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pyret-announce" "the
announcements mailing list"].
